# Drug Retargeting GUI

Drug Retargeting GUI is a Python application that provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for analyzing drug-protein interactions and identifying potential targets for drug repurposing.

## Overview

Drug retargeting, also known as drug repositioning, is the process of discovering new uses for existing drugs. This approach is particularly useful for orphan diseases, where new drug research may not be a priority. The Drug Retargeting GUI simplifies the analysis of drug-protein interaction networks, allowing users to explore potential targets for drug repurposing.

## Features

- **Disease-Protein Mapping:** Dynamically add disease-protein mappings to the system.
- **Drug Selection:** Select drugs from a dropdown list to analyze.
- **Search Functionality:** Find potential targets for selected drugs based on drug-protein interaction networks.
- **CSV Data Loading:** Load drug-protein data from a CSV file for analysis.
- **Hover Effect:** Visual feedback with hover effect on buttons.
